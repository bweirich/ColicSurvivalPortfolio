# ColicSurvivalPortfolio
Colic Survival Portfolio (Python) Colic Survival Portfolio (Python) This repository contains the python code for a colic Survival project. Details of the project can be read in the notebook.

Problem - 
Colic in horse is problem with the gastro-intestinal tract that causes abdominal pain. Colic can vary between mild cases to sever which can involve surgury. The cost of treatment can also vary greatly with the severity of the case.

This project will predict the survival of a horse based on the features of the medical condition of a horse. The ability to predict a horses survival will allow owners and veterinarians to make better decisions regarding the best interest of the horse and the cost to the owner.

Hypothesize solution - 
I have chosen Linear Regression, DecisionTree, RandomForest and KNeighborsClassifier to predict the outcomes. I will use the Classification Report to gauge the effectiveness of the different models to select the best option.

Select best model - 
Based on the Classification Report measurements of f1-score and accuracy the Logistic Regression is the best model for prediction.

Conclusion - 
Since the training dataset is fairly small I would recommend that more data is collected for the models to train on before the model is deployed for real world use in predictions.
